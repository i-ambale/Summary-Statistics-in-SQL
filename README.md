# Summary Statistics Report in SQL
¬© ExploreAI Academy

Project Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts and a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to create a summary statistics report using numeric functions and aggregations in SQL.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This notebook will not run on Google Colab because it requires a connection to a local MySQL database (united_nations). Ensure that your MySQL Workbench and database are set up on your local machine.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will:
‚úÖ Learn how to use SQL aggregate functions (e.g., MIN(), MAX(), AVG()).
‚úÖ Understand how to apply the GROUP BY clause for analyzing datasets at different levels.
‚úÖ Perform summary statistics analysis on the Access_to_Basic_Services table.

## SQL Queries Used
Basic Summary Statistics
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(Pct_managed_drinking_water_services) AS Min_pct_water,
    MAX(Pct_managed_drinking_water_services) AS Max_pct_water,
    AVG(Pct_managed_drinking_water_services) AS Avg_pct_water
FROM access_to_basic_services;
```
```sql
SELECT 
    Region,
    Sub_region,
    MIN(Pct_managed_drinking_water_services) AS Min_pct_water,
    MAX(Pct_managed_drinking_water_services) AS Max_pct_water,
    AVG(Pct_managed_drinking_water_services) AS Avg_pct_water
FROM access_to_basic_services
GROUP BY Region, Sub_region;
